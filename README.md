# Concurrency Course Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments from the [Concurrency Course](https://gitlab.com/Lipovsky/concurrency-course). It includes implementations of various concurrency abstractions such as mutexes, condition variables, semaphores, futures, thread pools, fibers, and lock-free data structures.
